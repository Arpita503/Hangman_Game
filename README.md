# Hangman_Game

🚀 Just Built a Hangman Game in Python! 🎮 Who doesn’t love a good word-guessing challenge? I just built a Hangman game using Python, where you have to guess the hidden word letter by letter. But be careful—too many wrong guesses, and you’re hanged! 💀😱

# 🛠️ Libraries Used in This Project

🔹 random – Picks a random word from the word list.

🔹 art – Displays ASCII art for different Hangman stages.

🔹 Custom Word List (words.py) – A collection of words to guess from.

# 🔥 What Makes This Game Fun?

✅ Keeps track of guessed letters (so no duplicate guesses!).

✅ Displays cool ASCII art for every wrong guess.

✅ Prints the hidden word progress after every turn.

✅ Tells you if you’ve won or lost in a dramatic way!
